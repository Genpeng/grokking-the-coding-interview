/**
 * The description of problem is as follow:
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the minimum number of
 * rooms required to hold all the meetings.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can
 * occur in any of the two rooms later.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Meetings: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Meetings: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,6]]
 * Output:2
 * Explanation: Since [1,4] overlaps with the other two meetings [2,3] and [3,6], we need two rooms to
 * hold all the meetings.
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Meetings: [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We will need one room for [2,3] and [3,5], and another room for [2,4] and [4,5].
